# Forecasting-tourism-2010
University project 

## Introduction
This project focuses on forecasting tourism demand using a dataset from the 2010 Tourism Forecasting Competition. The goal is to predict future tourism trends based on 518 time series related to various tourism activities, such as visitor numbers and expenditure. The project involves visualizing the data, partitioning it into training and validation sets, and generating naive forecasts. The performance of forecasts is evaluated using measures like MAPE and MASE. The project also explores combining different forecasting methods, including linear regression and exponential smoothing, to improve accuracy and automate the process.
